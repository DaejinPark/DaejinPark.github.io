## Tutorial: Introduction to Digital Signal Processing

_Intro to DSP_ is a half-day tutorial that uses material from _Think DSP_ to
introduce the fundamental ideas of Digital Signal Processing, in particular
spectral analysis: the idea that a signal that varies in time can be expressed
as a sum of frequency components, and that operations on signals can be
represented equivalently in terms of time or frequency.

If you don't quite understand what that means, this tutorial is for you!

Important: **Please bring headphones or earbuds!**  Many of the exercises in this tutorial
make noise.  If people don't have headphones, it's going to be chaos!

### Installation instructions

To prepare for this tutorial, you have these options:

1) Install Jupyter on your laptop and download my code from Git.

2) Run the Jupyter notebook on a virtual machine on Binder.
This is the easiest option, with one drawback: the virtual machine you get is temporary;
any work you do during the tutorial will be lost.

3) Just read the notebooks on GitHub.

Option 1 is the best choice if you are able to do it ahead of time, because it does not depend on the network at the conference.  Option 2 depends on network performance, which is unpredictable.  Option 3 is easy and reliable,
but you will only be able to read the notebooks; you won't be able to run the code or do the exercises.

Here are instructions for each option.

### Option 1

If you don't already have Jupyter, I highly recommend installing Anaconda, which is a Python distribution that contains everything you need for the workshop.  It is easy to install on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and because it does a
user-level install, it will not interfere with other Python installations.

[Information about installing Anaconda is here](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html).

When you install Anaconda, you should get Jupyter by default, but if not, run

```
    conda install jupyter
```

The code for the tutorial works in Python 2 and Python 3, but I recommend Python 3.

Once you have Jupyter, you can get my code from  this Git repository on Github.  If you have a Git client installed, you should be able to download it by running:

```
    git clone https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP.git
```

It should create a directory named `ThinkDSP`.
Otherwise you can download the repository in [this zip file](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.

Then cd into the new directory:

```
    cd ThinkDSP
```

To make sure you have the packages you need, you can use `environment.yml`
to create a Conda environment named `thinkdsp`

```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then activate the new environment

 ```
   conda activate thinkdsp
```

To start Jupyter, run:

```
    cd code
    jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter should launch your default browser or open a tab in an existing browser window.
If not, the Jupyter server should print a URL you can use.  For example, when I launch Jupyter, I get

```
    ~/ThinkDSP$ jupyter notebook
    [I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/downey/ThinkDSP
    [I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
    [I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
    [I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

In this case, the URL is [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).  
When you start your server, you might get a different URL.
Whatever it is, if you paste it into a browser, you should should see a home page with a list of the
notebooks in the repository.

Click on `chap01.ipynb`.  It should open the notebook for Chapter 1.

Select the cell with the import statements and press "Shift-Enter" to run the code in the cell.
If it works and you get no error messages, **you are all set**.  

If you get error messages about missing packages, you can install the packages you need using your
package manager, or install Anaconda.


### Option 2

You can run my notebook in a virtual machine on Binder. To launch the VM, press this button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP/master)

You should see a home page with a list of the notebooks in the repository.

Open `chap01.ipynb`. You should be able to run the notebook in your browser 
and try out the examples.  

However, be aware that the virtual machine you are running is temporary.
If you leave it idle for more than an hour or so, it will disappear along with any work you have done.

Special thanks to the generous people who run Binder, which makes it easy to share and reproduce computation.

### Option 3

You can read the notebooks on GitHub.  [The repository is here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP/tree/master/code).
You should see the list of files in the repo.   Open `chap01.ipynb`.  You should be able to read the notebook, but you won't be able to run the code.
